# Kitchen caos 
## Objective: 
My objective is to follow the [curse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t=4960s) made by [Codemonkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity) to learn how to create a "professional" game.

**I will not be using Unity like Codemonkey**, insted **i will use Godot 4.4.1** doing my best to translate from Unity to Godot this ReadMe will work as a type of ***jornal***

Another important note is that i will be using **GDscript** and not **C#**, altogh it is possible to use C# in godot i for personal reasons i choose to use GDscript instead
